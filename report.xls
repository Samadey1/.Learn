Hopefully i become better at doing this

I could remember my first github experience, it was like driving without a direction but now that is long gone.

I'm now learning fast with help of John, thank you JohnnyMan.

Just be rest assured that I will make you proud. 

I know the road is rough now but there is surely a clear path ahead.
